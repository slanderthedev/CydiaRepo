</div>

<div class="container">
		<center><b><p style="color:white;">My community name and my gamertag is Slander, however, you can call me Tyler. I am a 19 year old beginning dev in the community who honestly doesn't 
		really care where my code goes and what I make. I mess with code in a ton of different sources. I make mod menus for Call of Duty, I mess with HTML, I am getting into tweak development, etc.<br /><br />

  <center><h3 style="color:white;">How I Got into the Jailbreak Community?</h3><center>
</div>

<div class="container">
		<center><b><p style="color:white;"> I got into the Jailbreak community back when the iPhone 4 was just coming out in stores. I was in middle school and were hearing about how the newer iPhone 4S had Siri.
		I became curious and decided to do some research if it were possible to get Siri on an iPhone 4. I came across a Jailbreak tutorial using Redsnow on iOS 6. I followed the tut with no idea what the hell
		I was getting myself into. It soon came to the step where the Redsnow Pineapple showed up on the screen and started bursting through code down the screen. At that point, I started freaking out so bad, thinking
		I just screwed up my phone, my dads gonna be pissed at me, how am I gonna fix it?, etc. Turns out I just had to wait another 2 minutes for it to finish and things were just peachy.
		
		Later that night, I got Siri sorta working and I realized what Jailbreaking was. I started tweaking and theming my device so much that everyone I went to school with was so confused and amazed at what I had.
		That started my Jailbreaking future.</p></b><center>
